 **1. Locate the disruption of AI in five areas**  
**AI is disrupting these five key sectors**:  
1. **Healthcare**:  
   - Replacing manual diagnostics with AI-powered tools (e.g., radiology scans analyzed by algorithms).  
   - Automating drug discovery (e.g., AlphaFold predicting protein structures).  
2. **Finance**:  
   - Algorithmic trading replacing human traders.  
   - AI chatbots displacing customer service roles (e.g., banking support staff).  
3. **Manufacturing**:  
   - Transition to fully automated "lights-out" factories with minimal human workers.  
   - Predictive maintenance systems replacing manual equipment checks.  
4. **Retail**:  
   - Cashier-less stores (e.g., Amazon Go) reducing demand for checkout staff.  
   - Algorithmic pricing strategies replacing human analysts.  
5. **Transportation**:  
   - Autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo, Tesla) threatening driver jobs.  
   - AI logistics systems displacing roles in shipping and delivery.

 **2. What advantages is AI bringing in five areas?**  
**Key benefits of AI in five sectors**:  
1. **Healthcare**:  
   - Faster, more accurate diagnoses (e.g., AI detecting tumors in scans).  
   - Personalized treatment plans based on genetic data (e.g., IBM Watson).  
2. **Finance**:  
   - Real-time fraud detection (e.g., Mastercard saving billions annually).  
   - Automated portfolio management via robo-advisors (e.g., Betterment).  
3. **Manufacturing**:  
   - Predictive maintenance cutting downtime (e.g., Siemens reducing costs by 30%).  
   - Zero-defect production through AI quality control (e.g., Tesla).  
4. **Retail**:  
   - Hyper-personalized shopping experiences (e.g., Amazon’s recommendation engine).  
   - Efficient inventory management (e.g., Zara predicting fashion trends).  
5. **Transportation**:  
   - Safer roads with autonomous vehicles (e.g., Tesla’s collision reduction).  
   - Fuel-efficient route optimization (e.g., UPS saving 10M gallons of fuel yearly).

 **3. What disadvantages is AI bringing in five areas?**  
**Key challenges and risks of AI in five sectors**:  
1. **Healthcare**:  
   - **Privacy breaches**: Sensitive patient data vulnerable to hacking.  
   - **Diagnostic bias**: AI models underperforming for underrepresented groups.  
2. **Finance**:  
   - **Job losses**: Traders, analysts, and call center roles at risk.  
   - **Market instability**: Flash crashes caused by AI-driven trading.  
3. **Manufacturing**:  
   - **Unemployment**: Low-skilled workers displaced by automation.  
   - **High costs**: Expensive AI integration for small businesses.  
4. **Retail**:  
   - **Privacy concerns**: Tracking customer behavior invasively.  
   - **Job displacement**: Cashiers and warehouse staff replaced by robots.  
5. **Transportation**:  
   - **Ethical dilemmas**: Who’s liable in self-driving car accidents?  
   - **Driver unemployment**: Truckers and taxi drivers losing jobs.
